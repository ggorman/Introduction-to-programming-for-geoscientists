See the solutions under [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/users/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/blob/master/notebook/Lecture-3-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists-Solutions.ipynb). Or download the .ipynb file [here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-3-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists-Solutions.ipynb).

Update: I also put an example [battleship game](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/battleship.ipynb) online. Have fun :-)
