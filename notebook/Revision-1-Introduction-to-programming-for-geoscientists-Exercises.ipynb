      "As an egg cooks, the proteins first denature and then coagulate. When the temperature exceeds a critical point, reactions begin and proceed faster as the temperature increases. In the egg white the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 63 C, while in the yolk the proteins start to coagulate for temperatures above 70 C. For a soft boiled egg, the white needs to have been heated long enough to coagulate at a temperature above 63 C, but the yolk should not be heated above 70 C. For a hard boiled egg, the center of the yolk should be allowed to reach 70 C. The following formula expresses the time $t$ it takes (in seconds) for the center of the yolk to reach the temperature $T_y$ (in Celsius degrees):\n",

      "Here, $M, \\rho, c$ and $K$ are properties of the egg: $M$ is the mass, $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $K$ is thermal conductivity. Relevant values are $M$ = 47 g for a small egg and $M$ = 67 g for a large egg, $\\rho$ = 1.038 g cm$^{-3}$, $c$ = 3.7 J g$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, and $K$ = 5.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ W cm$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Furthermore, $T_w$ is the temperature (in C degrees) of the boiling water, and $T_o$ is the original temperature (in C degrees) of the egg before being put in the water. Implement the formula in a program, set $T_w$ = 100 C and $T_y$ = 70 C, and compute $t$ for a large egg taken from the fridge ($T_o$ = 4 C) and from room temperature ($T_o$ = 20 C). \n"
